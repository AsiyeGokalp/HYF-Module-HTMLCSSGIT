1.After creating a file by using 'touch' or a folder by using 'mkdir',the file/folder can be hidden by moving it under a new name.
(.) should be place at the begining of the new name,it indicates that the file/folder is hidden.
And it can be display by ' ls -a'.

for folder:
$ mkdir myfolder
$ mv myfolder/ .myfolder/
$ ls      ( checking > it is hidden, not displayed)
$ ls -a   (now it's displayed)

for file:
$ touch myfile.txt
$ mv myfile.txt .myfile.txt
$ ls      ( checking > it is hidden, not displayed)
$ ls -a   (now it's displayed)


2. For creating multiple nested directory we can folow two methods:
first one is longer way;
$ cd c/users
$ mkdir myusername
$ cd myusername
$ mkdir these
$ cd these 
$ mkdir folders
$ cd are
$ mkdir just
$ cd just 
$ mkdir for
$ cd for 
$ mkdir fun 
$cd fun

second one is shorter way;
$ cd c/users
$ mkdir -p myusername/these/folders/are/just/for/fun



3.
$ touch myfile.txt
$ echo -n "first message" >> myfile.txt
$ echo -e "\nsecond message" >> myfile.txt
$ cat myfirst.txt
